# ðŸ¦  COVID-19 Symptoms Prediction #

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

**Description**\
A **Python-based Machine Learning project** that predicts whether a person is **COVID Positive or Negative** based on their symptoms.  
The project uses two ML models â€” **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** â€” and compares their performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
It is lightweight and runs in the terminal or Google Colab environment.

## Live Demo

[Click here to try on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19cHk3g4pZnjPGbtVKKqAaVRpX-QIGgYi?usp=sharing) 

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/divya-00/covid19_symptom_predictor.git
   
2. Open the folder in your preferred Python environment (like **Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, or IDLE**).

## How to Use

1. Run the script in a Python environment:

```bash
python covid_prediction.py
```
2. The program will:

- Ask you a series of **Yes/No questions** about symptoms.  
- Convert your answers into numeric values (`1` for Yes, `0` for No).  
- Use the trained ML model to predict **COVID Positive / COVID Negative**.  
- Display a neat **tabular summary** of your inputs along with the final result.  

### Sample User Input Table



| Symptom       | Your Answer |
|---------------|------------|
| Fever         | Yes        |
| Dry Cough     | No         |
| Sore throat   | Yes        |
| Running Nose  | No         |
| Fatigue       | Yes        |

**âœ… COVID Negative**
